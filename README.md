meketre-pelagios-mapping
========================

Simple Java application that transforms SQL database dumps from the [Meketre](http://www.meketre.org) project to Pelagios-compliant annotations.

TODO make this work as a command-line app, with dump + mapping file locations configurable via a properties file
TODO think up a more generic way to specify the place URI crosswalk file ('mapping.txt') - maybe this should work directly off a CSV file (which we can generate from ISAW's GoogleDocs spreadsheet) 
TODO add dump + mapping files (plus a note of the date they were generated) to the repository
